# Framework for AI-Agents in `golang` 

## Current Ideas

1. Building simple `agents` structure for defining individual agents
2. Defining `database` for local and public data storing/retrieval 
3. Defining `retrieval` procedure for ensuring RAG-worklow
4. Defining `tooling` for making agents interact with external tools
5. Establishing an `explainability` framework for explaining decisions of agents
6. Potentially implenting `knowledge graphs` or `causality` for better representation
